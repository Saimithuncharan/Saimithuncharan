## Analytics Home

[Analytics Home](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/analytics) is the highest-level entry point for creator analytics and is located in the left navigation of [Creator Hub](https://create.roblox.com/). Analytics Home enables you to:

- Monitor the analytics of multiple experiences at once
- Track avatar item sales and revenue

### Monitoring Experiences

You can monitor the analytics of up to nine Roblox experiences by putting them into a **watchlist**. If you have analytics permissions for the experience, your watchlist provides the following analytics at a glance:

- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Number of unique players who joined the game at least once in the given day.
- **New Users**: Number of DAUs who are first-time users.
- **Session Time**: Total play time divided by number of individual sessions each day.
- **Day 1 Retention**: Percentage of new users who played again after their first session ended.
- **Daily Revenue**: Total amount of Robux earned by the experience in a day.

If you add an experience to your watchlist that you don't have analytics permissions for, the card only populates publicly viewable stats. These include:

- Like Ratio
- CCU
- Updated Date
- Title
- Owner

"Watchlists are applied on the account level, are private, and persist when toggling between groups. To add an experience to your watchlist, paste the **Experience URL** or add it from your **Experience Table**, which is a list view of all the experiences owned by your account or selected group.

Clicking on an experience you're monitoring takes you to the experience overview page. If applicable, [Analytics Insights](#analytics-insights) offer direction on next steps and redirect you to applicable documentation and relevant analytics.

### Tracking Avatar Sales and Revenue

Avatar items you've sold automatically appear within the **Avatar Items** tab. Here, you can:          
- **View top performing items**: See your top selling and grossing avatar items over a selected time period.
- **Analyze overall sales and revenue**: Showcase up to eight top items on a time-series graph.
- **Monitor your catalog**: Examine a table with up to 200 items, filterable by item category and sales types, and sortable by sales and total revenue.
